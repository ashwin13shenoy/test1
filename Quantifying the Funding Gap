Case Study Competition Walkthrough Script (for you to read on phone)

Opening
“Good [morning/afternoon], thank you all for joining. I’ll walk you through the finValley 2025 case competition problem statement. This is designed around a $10B multi-asset hedge fund that is exploring data lineage and tokenization to address real business challenges.”

Context
“The fund faces three key challenges:

Capital recycling pressure, with a relatively low DPI.

Over-allocation to illiquid strategies, especially after public market drawdowns.

Restrictions from regulatory exposure limits.

The competition asks participants to propose solutions using data lineage and tokenization frameworks, supported by AI-driven insights.”

Challenge 1
“The first challenge is GP-led secondaries and recycling. Participants need to propose how technology can create transparency and accelerate liquidity events.”

Challenge 2
“The second challenge is fund liquidity. Here, the focus is how tokenization of fund interests could enable partial redemptions, secondary trading, or liquidity sleeves.”

Challenge 3
“The third challenge is accessing HNW and retail capital. Participants must think about feeder fund structures, regulatory requirements, and how blockchain-based tokenization can broaden investor access while still staying compliant.”

Expectations
“Solutions should address both:

Business side: ROI, risk mitigation, regulatory compliance.

Technology side: Architecture, AI use cases, and data lineage for traceability.”

What Can Be Tokenized
“We’re guiding participants to think about tokenizing LP fund units, secondary interests, NAV-based facilities, and feeder funds. This creates liquidity, fractional access, and audit-ready transparency.”

AI & Reporting Angle
“Participants are encouraged to consider FundFlow-style dashboards: real-time exposure monitoring, risk alerts, liquidity waterfall reports, and predictive analytics. The idea is to show how AI can make investor reporting and compliance seamless.”

Evaluation
“Submissions will be judged across:

Business understanding

Innovation

Feasibility

ROI and risk

Clarity of communication”

Closing
“In short, the competition is about connecting data lineage + tokenization + AI into a compelling, realistic solution for a hedge fund under real pressures. The goal is to test business analysis, creativity, and structured problem-solving.”
